[**Tutorial how to install/move maps**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2_Vr_RfcE)

```
Just move the zip files into a folder name Maps in Vulnus's file locations
```
* Important moving maps info from MrfieryPotato
```
post map zips
put map zips in your maps folder and the game will extract them for you etc etc

MAKE SURE YOUR MAP IS FORMATTED CORRECTLY
the zip file should only contain map files, no folders
Map.zip > meta.json, music.mp3 etc IS CORRECT
Map_Wrong.zip > Map Wrong > meta.json, music.mp3 etc IS WRONG AND WILL CAUSE MAP LOADING TO FAIL IF PUT IN THE MAP FOLDER
```

## About SoundSpace or Vulnus
SoundSpace is currently down due to Roblox update previously and so the developer decide to build a game outside of Roblox named **Vulnus**. To install, join the Discord Server **-->** [**Vulnus**](https://discord.gg/w3PdcaG) **<--** for further infomation!

**Reminder, don't mind the branches ontop, those are my old maps to show how bad I'm back then XD**
