[**Tutorial how to install/move maps**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2_Vr_RfcE)

```
Just move the zip files into a folder name Maps in Vulnus's file locations
```
* Importantinfo from MrfieryPotato
```
post map zips
put map zips in your maps folder and the game will extract them for you etc etc

MAKE SURE YOUR MAP IS FORMATTED CORRECTLY
the zip file should only contain map files, no folders
Map.zip > meta.json, music.mp3 etc IS CORRECT
Map_Wrong.zip > Map Wrong > meta.json, music.mp3 etc IS WRONG AND WILL CAUSE MAP LOADING TO FAIL IF PUT IN THE MAP FOLDER
```
